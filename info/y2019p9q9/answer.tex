    This can be viewed as a compression problem, so since each question reveals one bit of information, we need to ask what the entropy of the source is.

    In our case, it is:

    $\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n (\frac{1}{2})^i \log_2 ((\frac{1}{2})^i)$

    This has known limit of 2, so this source has 2 bits of entropy.

    Therefore, we can expect to ask 2 yes/no questions by the Source Coding Theorem, which tells us we can always compress down to the entropy of a source, but not any lower (without losing information).

    The sequence of questions that would be best to pick is the sequence of questions that ensures we half the remaining entropy with each question, so we ask:

    Is the number 1?

    Is the number 2?

    $\ldots$
