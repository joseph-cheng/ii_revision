  \item
    This is Fano's equality, and tells us the following lower bound:

    $P(e) \leq \frac{H(X|Y) - 1}{\log_2{\mathcal{N}}}$

  \item
    This error correction scheme fails when there is more than 1 bit error.

  \item
    Its probability distribution is given as $p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}$

    The entropy of a white noise source is the source having $\sigma^2$ that has maximal entropy.

  \item
    Not relevant, but you should low-pass the signal so that the bandwidth only extends to $\pm \frac{1}{2}f_s$

  \item
    Not relevant
