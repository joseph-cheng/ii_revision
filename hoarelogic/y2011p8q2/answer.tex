\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

  \item
    We construct:

    \texttt{SKIP} $\triangleq$ \texttt{X=X}

    The assignment rule tells us that $\{P[X / X]\}SKIP\{P\}$ holds for all $P$, and since $P[X / X] = P$, we have $\{P\}SKIP\{P\}$, as required.

    \item
      We propose:

      \texttt{IF S THEN C} $\triangleq$ \texttt{IF S THEN C ELSE SKIP}

      Applying the conditional rule, we get:

      \[
        \frac{\vdash \{P\wedge S\}C\{Q\} \hspace{15pt} \vdash\{P \wedge \neg S\}\texttt{SKIP}\{Q\}}{\vdash \{P\}IF\ S\ THEN\ C\{Q\}}
      .\] 

      We have that $\vdash \{P \wedge S\}C\{Q\}$ is true by assumption.

      Then, by post-condition weakening, to prove $\vdash\{P \wedge \neg S\}SKIP\{Q\}$ we can prove $\vdash \{P\wedge \neg S\}SKIP\{P \wedge \neg S\}$, which is true by (a).

      Therefore, we have $\vdash \{P\}IF\ S\ THEN\ C\{Q\}$

      \item
        We provide the command:

        \texttt{MAGIC} $\triangleq$ \{WHILE 0=0 DO SKIP\}

        Assuming we have integers and an equality operator. If not, then we encode $\top$ in some other way.

        We provide a proof outline:
\begin{verbatim}
{P}
{P /\ T}
WHILE 0=0 DO
  {P /\ T /\ 0=0}
  SKIP
  {P /\ T /\ 0=0}
  {P /\ T}
{P /\ T /\ ~(0=0)}
{P /\ T /\ ~T}
{Q} (explosion)
\end{verbatim}









        
    \end{enumerate}
