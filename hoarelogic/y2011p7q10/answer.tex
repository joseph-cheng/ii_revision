  \item
    We provide the following LTL formula:

    $F (G p)$

    This means that on some suffix of every path, $p$ becomes always true.

    \item
      We provide the following CTL formula:

      $AG (E F p)$

      This means that from every reachable state ($AG$), there exists a path for which $p$ eventually becomes true.

      \item
        We provide the following LTL formula:

        $(p \wedge (X p) \wedge \cdots \wedge (X^{99} p)) \implies (X^{99} F q)$

        This means that for all paths, if $p$ is true at the start state, and $p$ is true on the next state, etc. until the 100th state, then after that state, $q$ is true somewhere on the path.

        \item
          We provide the following LTL formula:

          $(G (F p)) \implies (G (F q))$

          Here, $(G (F p))$ means that on every suffix of the path, $p$ eventually becomes true, i.e. $p$ is true infinitely often.

          Therefore, the whole formula means that if $p$ is true infinitely often, then $q$ is true infinitely often.
