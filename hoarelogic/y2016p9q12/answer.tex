    We might prefer to model check rather than use logical inference because model checking can guarantee that we either prove a formula, or disprove a formula, since the search space is finite. Logical inference, however, is equivalent to finding a proof, and the search space is infinite, so we cannot be guaranteed to prove/disprove a formula.

    Furthermore, model checking provides a counterexample for a refutation, whereas logical inference cannot always do this.

      We give the syntax of the LTL formula $\phi$:
