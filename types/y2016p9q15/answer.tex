        The Curry-Howard correspondence describes a correspondence between types, programs, etc., and mathematical proofs.

        In particular, we have that types correspond to formulae, and programs correspond to proofs: so having a program of type $T$ is a proof for the corresponding formula for $T$.

        For example, we can consider function types $T_1 \rightarrow T_2$ to be like implication: if we have a proof for $P \implies Q$, and a proof for $P$, we have a proof for $Q$. Similarly, if we have a program of type $T_1 \rightarrow T_2$, and a program of type $T_1$, then we can construct a program of type $T_2$ (through function application).
